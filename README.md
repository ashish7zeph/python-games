Well, I have been learning python for a while and I, kind of really enjoyed working with it. Who won't !! Its a really
cool Language ever existed in the field of programming. Python makes stuffs a lot easier. So it does with the game development!! 
And I tried to build few mini python games.

It really was a fun activity for me to work on these, as I've been in love with programming and well game development too!!

These are really basic python games, but working on them was quite interesting and it leads to an addition of knowledge
of python programming and its different modules that are helpful for different purposes.
