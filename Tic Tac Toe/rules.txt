 About game:

	nothing much! 
	Its just the regular tic tac toe game.

	But the difference is you are playing here against a basic AI
	(Artificial Intelligence) Algorithm.

 Rules:
	
	1. Your key is X(cross) and computer's is O(zero).
	   You will get a chance to play a move first.

	2. Play your move by typing (1-9) for corresponding position on crossboard as in your Numpad.
	   AI will play a move against you after.

	3. Meanwhile you can press anytime : plus(+) -> new game | minus(-) -> quit

	4. Press y(yes) or n(no), if you want to play again or not when it asks. 


 Enjoy the GAME!!!
